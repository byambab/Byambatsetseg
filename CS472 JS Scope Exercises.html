      <dt>1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):

        <pre>
          x = 1;
          var a = 5;
          var b = 10;
          var c = function(a, b, c) {
          var x = 10;
          document.write(x);
          document.write(a);
          var f = function(a, b, c) {
          b = a;
          document.write(b);
          b = c;
          var x = 5;
          }
          f(a,b,c);
          document.write(b);
           }
          c(8,9,10);
          document.write(b);
          document.write(x);
          }
        </pre>

      </dd>
      <dt>2. What is the difference between a method and function? </dt>
      <dd> A method is a function that belongs to a class. In JavaScript, however, a method is a function that belongs
        to an object. </dd>
      <dt>3. What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method? </dt>
      <dd>Inside an object's method, the object refers to itself as this. </dd>
      <dt>4. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?</dt>
      <dd>In JavaScript this always refers to the "owner" of the function we're executing, or rather, to the object that
        a function is a method of. When we define our faithful function doSomething() in a page, its owner is the page,
        or rather, the window object (or global object) of JavaScript.</dd>
      <dt>5. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?</dt>
      <dd>The value of this, when used in an object, is the object itself.

        In a constructor function this does not have a value. It is a substitute for the new object. The value of this
        will become the new object when a new object is created. </dd>
      <dt>6. Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword
        'this'.
        When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?</dt>
      <dd>Refer to the prototype x</dd>
      <dt>7. What is a free variable in JavaScript?</dt>
      <dd>A variable referred to by a function that is not one of its parameters or local variables.
      </dd>
      <dt>8. Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function
        that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.</dt>
      <dd>
        <pre>
          var Student = {
            name: 'fred',
            major: 'music',
            fn: function (e1, e2) {
                if (e1 === e2) {
                    return e1**4;
                } else {
                    if (e1 &lt e2) {
                        return e1;
                    } else {
                        return e2;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        </pre>

      </dd>
      <dt>9. Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor
        function.
        Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.</dt>
      <dd>
        <pre>function Employee(name, salary, position) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
        this.position = position;
      }
      
      var emp1 = new Employee('Bat', 8000, 'Front');
      var emp2 = new Employee('Zezeg', 9000, 'Back');
      var emp3 = new Employee('Bud', 12000, 'Manager');
    </pre>
      </dd>
      <dt>10. Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the
        arguments.</dt>
      <dd>
        <pre> function fn(...args) {
        if (args && args.length) {
            return args.reduce((accumulator, currentValue, currentIndex, array) =>
                accumulator * currentValue);
        }
        return 0;
    }</pre>
      </dd>
      <dt> 11. Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments</dt>
      <dd>
        <pre>
        var fn = (a, b, c) => {
          return Math.max(a, b, c);
        }
      </pre>
      </dd>
    </dl>
