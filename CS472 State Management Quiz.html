    <dl>
      <dt>1. Can post requests be bookmarked? What are the problems? </dt>
      <dd>
        Yes the post request can be bookmarked but there is no meaning of doing it because bookmark only consist of URL
        and all the
        form parameters will be lost and web server will not know what to do with since it will be expecting some
        parameters. This happens because post request does not contains parameters in the URL. Only in get request form
        parameter are shown in URL.
      </dd>
      <dt>2. What is the purpose of request dispatching? </dt>
      <dd> passes the request to another resource on the server.</dd>
      <dt>3. What is the difference between redirect and request dispatch? </dt>
      <dd>• passes the request to another resource on the server, request and response objects passed to destination
        servlet. Browser is completely unaware of servlet forward and hence the URL in browser address bar will remain
        unchanged
        • server sends HTTP status code 3xx to client along with the redirect URL (usually 302 temporary redirect),
        client then sends a new request to the URL, address bar will change to new URL, only http message sent, request
        and response objects cannot be sent
      </dd>
      <dt>4. What is an attribute?</dt>
      <dd>Attributes are objects on the server. They promote communication between components. Only request attributes
        are thread-safe. Following scopes: request scope, session scope, application scope
        The servlet programmer can pass information from one servlet to another using attributes. It is just like
        passing object from one class to another so that we can reuse the same object repeatedly.
      </dd>
      <dt>5. What is the difference between attributes and parameters? </dt>
      <dd>The main difference is that Parameters come from the client request. The server side sets attributes.
        Attribute return object and parameter return string. </dd>
      <dt>6. What are dangers of using attributes? </dt>
      <dd>Context scope attributes are shared by every servlet and every request in the application and have to be
        careful, not thread safe.
        Only request attributes are thread-safe</dd>
      <dt>7. What does it mean to say that http is stateless? Give an example of a stateful protocol.</dt>
      <dd>HTTP is stateless protocol, which means that after a web server responds to a request, there is no "memory" of
        the request or who sent it. TCP is an example of a stateful protocol.
      </dd>
      <dt>8. Give 5 different methods for maintaining state information (count each attribute scope as one method).
      </dt>

      <dt>9. How long does a session last?</dt>
      <dd>A session lasts until the browser is closed or until the user has logged out of the application.</dd>
      <dt>10. What is a cookie, and how long does a cookie last? </dt>
      <dd>A cookie is a small piece of data sent by the server and stored in the browser. Cookies last according to the
        type. Temporary cookies last until the lifetime of the browser whereas permanent cookies last until its max set
        age.</dd>
      <dt>11. What is the purpose of URL rewriting? </dt>
      <dd>URL rewriting is a way to support anonymous session tracking since using URL rewriting dynamically modifies
        the
        local URL to contain some extra information.</dd>
      <dt>12. Why does the request attribute report ‘null’ for the maintaining state demo?</dt>
      <dd>The request attribute reports 'null' for the maintaining state demo because local attribute requestState is
        not
        transferred to the post.</dd>
