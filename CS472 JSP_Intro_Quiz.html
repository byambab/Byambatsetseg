      <dt>1.What is the main value of Java Server Pages?</dt>
      <dd>
        The main value of Java Server Pages (JSP) is that it simplifies HTML compared to how it was done with servlet
        and also separates the view from the business logic.

      </dd>

      <dt>2.How are JSP pages related to servlets?</dt>
      <dd>

        JSP pages are related to servlets since the JSP pages are finally converted to Servlets. When the JSP page is
        first requested, the JSP server compiles the class generated by the JSP engine to a servlet.

      </dd>

      <dt>3.How are JSP pages related to HTML?</dt>
      <dd>

        JSP pages are a combination of the HTML code and the Java code. JSP runs on the server whereas HTMl runs on the
        browser.

      </dd>

      <dt>4.Give an example of a JSP scriptlet and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.</dt>
      <dd>

        Scriptlets are nothing but java code enclosed within <% and %> tags. JSP container moves the statements enclosed
        in it to _jspService() method while generating servlet from JSP.

        The use of scriplets in JSP is for Java statements:

        <code><% java statements %>

          e.g. <% count++; %></code>

      </dd>

      <dt> 5.Give an example of a JSP declaration and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.</dt>
      <dd>

        JSP declaration are used to declare the instance variable and/or methods inside JSP.

        The use of declaration in JSP <code>

      <%! java declaration statements %>

      e.g. <%! int count = 0; %> </code>
      </dd>

      <dt> 6.Give an example of a JSP comment and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.</dt>
      <dd>
        JSP comments are used to are used to comments inside JSP.
        The comments are commented as

        <code><%-- jsp comments --%></code>
      </dd>

      <dt>7.Give an example of a JSP expression and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.</dt>
      <dd>
        JSP Expression are used to insert Java expression inside JSP. Expects a Java expression and put it inside
        out.println() in service method.

        The use is as follows:
        <code>
      <%= java expression %>

      e.g. <%= ++count %> which is equivalent to out.println(++count); </code>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        8.Give an example of a JSP directive and show how it will look in the JSP servlet. method). </dt>
      <dd>
        JSP directives control the processing of an entire JSP page. It gives directions to the server regarding
        processing of a page.

        The use is as follows:

        <%@ .... %>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        9.Explain how an EL expression is evaluated.</dt>
      <dd>
        An EL expression is a compact expression of systematic evaluation of the page, request, session and application
        scopes. Also if EL cannot find a value for the attribute it ignore it and results null i.e. EL is "null
        friendly".
      </dd>
      <dt>
        10.Explain how servlet attributes are involved in EL expressions. </dt>
      <dd>
        The servlet attribute are involved in EL expression as follows:

        EL uses by default PageContext#findAttribute() which scans in subsequently the page, request, session and
        application scopes for the firstnext non-null attribute value matching the given attribute name.

        We can explicitly specify the different scopes as ${pageScode}, ${requestScope}, ${sessionScope} or
        ${applicationScope}.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        11.Explain how servlets and JSPs use request dispatch to interact. </dt>
      <dd>
        A RequestDispatcher object can forward a client's request to a resource or include the resource itself in the
        response back to the client. A resource can be another servlet, or an HTML file, or a JSP file, etc. The other
        servlet or JSP is called as if an HTTP request was sent to it by a browser.
